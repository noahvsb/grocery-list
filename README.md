# grocery-list

A way to create and share grocery lists easily.

## Backstory

This started as a bit of a protest.

My mother wanted a way to have a grocery list for the family online, for convenience.

My sister found an app for this, where everyone needs to create their own account. But the information on a grocery list is not confidential, so having an account to protect this information makes absolutely no sense.

Therefore I decided to create this website so you can just share your grocery list using links. No extra apps or account needed.

Don't use it too much, because I'm using the unpaid version of supabase.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### build before committing

npm run build
